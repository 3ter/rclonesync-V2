test_rclone_args

Several args passed.  --size-only changes the operations.

Note that the --size-only param is honored by rclone, but not rclonesync.  rclonesync copies the newer :Path2:file21.txt to :Path1:, and
rlcone sync does not copy the newer :Path1:file20.txt to :Path2:
(not sure why --size-only is not hornored for the ChangeCmds Copy commands)
